### Business Context
- Target audience: Mobile service businesses (mechanics, groomers, cleaners, etc.)
- Need for professional web presence that converts mobile visitors
- Emphasis on local SEO and mobile user experience
- Template approach allows for scalable deployment across multiple brands
- **Security Critical**: Handle customer contact info, business data, and potentially payment information

### Current Task: Mobile Performance Optimization (PageSpeed Insights)
**User Request**: "I have attached screenshots from PageSpeed Insights with recommendations on how to improve load speed on Mobile devices. Can we implement any of this easily and will it improve things? What else can be done to make mobile load speed as quick as possible We're running the free layer of Cloudflare at the moment too, so can adjust settings on that if you'd like."

**PageSpeed Insights Analysis:**
Based on the provided screenshots, there are several high-impact optimization opportunities:

1. **Reduce unused JavaScript** - Est savings of 133 KiB
   - 2uguru.com vendor chunk (217.1 KiB total, 133.1 KiB unused)
   - Significant opportunity for code splitting and tree shaking

2. **Serve images in next-gen formats** - Est savings of 59 KiB  
   - Convert service images (oil-change.jpeg, logbook.avif, purchase-inspection.avif, battery.avif, breakdown.avif) to WebP/AVIF
   - Current images: 947.7 KiB total, 687.6 KiB potential savings

3. **Properly size images** - Est savings of 688 KiB
   - Multiple service images are oversized for their display dimensions
   - Need responsive image sizing and optimization

4. **Defer offscreen images** - Est savings of 182 KiB
   - Car manufacturer logos (VW, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, Skoda, Audi, Isuzu, Nissan) loading eagerly
   - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content

**Additional Optimization Opportunities:**
- Cloudflare free tier optimizations (Brotli compression, minification, caching)
- Critical CSS inlining
- Font optimization and preloading
- Resource hints (preconnect, dns-prefetch)
- Service Worker for caching strategy

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Total Potential Savings**: ~962 KiB (133 + 59 + 688 + 182)
- **Expected Performance Gain**: Significant improvement in LCP, FCP, and overall mobile experience
- **Implementation Difficulty**: Medium - requires image optimization pipeline and code splitting

### Previous Task: Quote Chat Sending Mechanism Implementation
**User Request**: "The Get Quick quote button using the chat popout across the site - how does this actually SEND when the time comes? We need to set that up."

**Current Analysis:**
The "Get Quick Quote" chat functionality successfully collects lead data through a 4-step process:
1. **Location** - User's suburb/location
2. **Service** - Selected service type (Car Check, Oil & Brake Service, etc.)
3. **Contact** - Name and phone number
4. **Final Message** - Optional additional details

**Problem Identified:**
The chat collects all lead data in the `leadData` state object but **does not actually send it anywhere**. When the chat reaches the 'complete' step, it only:
- Displays a summary of collected information
- Shows a phone button for direct calling
- **Missing**: No API call, email sending, database storage, or any mechanism to deliver the lead to the business

**Specific Requirements:**
1. **Lead Data Transmission**: Implement mechanism to send collected lead data when chat completes
2. **Delivery Method**: Determine best approach (email, SMS, webhook, database, etc.)
3. **Error Handling**: Handle failed sends gracefully with user feedback
4. **Confirmation**: Provide clear confirmation to user that quote request was sent
5. **Business Notification**: Ensure business owner receives lead immediately
6. **Data Security**: Implement secure transmission with proper validation
7. **Template Compatibility**: Solution should work across all mobile service business types

**Context**: This is critical for lead generation - currently the chat provides great UX but doesn't actually deliver leads to the business, making it non-functional for its primary purpose.

# Archive: Completed Tasks, Historical Notes, and Resolved Issues

*Archive section for completed work - to be populated as project progresses* 

**EXECUTOR MODE - Task 18 Completed Successfully! ✅**

#### Task 18: Location Page Template for Burleigh ✅ **COMPLETED**

**EXECUTOR MODE - Task 20: Fix Cloudflare Pages Build Configuration ⚡ **ACTIVE**

#### Task 20: Fix Cloudflare Pages Build Configuration ⚡ **ACTIVE**
**Success Criteria:**
- [⚡] Update Cloudflare Pages build settings to match Next.js standalone configuration
- [ ] Change build output directory from `out` to `.next` 
- [ ] Verify build command is correct for standalone mode
- [ ] Test successful deployment to Cloudflare Pages
- [ ] Confirm all pages and functionality work in production

**Problem Identified:**
- Cloudflare Pages is configured for static export (looking for `out` directory)
- Our Next.js config uses `output: 'standalone'` (creates `.next` directory)
- Build fails with: "The file '/opt/buildhome/repo/out/routes-manifest.json' couldn't be found"

**High-level Task Breakdown:**

**20.1. Update Cloudflare Pages Build Settings** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Change build output directory from `out` to `.next`
- Verify build command is `npm run build` (correct)
- Ensure framework preset is "Next.js" (correct)
- **ADDITIONAL FIX**: Set `unoptimized: true` for images (required for static export)
- **Success Criteria**: Cloudflare Pages configured for Next.js standalone mode

**20.2. Test Build and Deployment** ⚡ **STARTING**
- Trigger new build with updated settings
- Verify successful build completion
- Test deployed site functionality
- **Success Criteria**: Site deploys successfully and all features work

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Next.js Config Fixed**: `output: 'export'` with `unoptimized: true` for static export
- ✅ **Changes Committed and Pushed**: Latest configuration pushed to GitHub (commit d3bd475)
- ✅ **Static Export Routes Fixed**: Added `dynamic = 'force-static'` to robots.ts and sitemap.ts (commit dbfc703)
- ✅ **Next.js Build Succeeds**: Static export generates all pages correctly in `out` directory
- ✅ **Testimonials Animation Fixed**: Replaced inline animation with Tailwind class for production compatibility (commit 851a06e)
- ❌ **@cloudflare/next-on-pages Fails**: Cloudflare Pages is running `npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages@1` which expects standalone build
- 🎯 **Root Cause**: Build command incompatibility - need to change Framework preset from "Next.js" to "None"
- ⚡ **Action Required**: Update Cloudflare Pages Framework preset to "None" to use standard `npm run build`
