# Mobile Services Website Template - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation (Revised)

### Project Overview
Building a generic, mobile-first website template for mobile services businesses (mobile mechanic, mobile dog groomer, etc.) that can be easily personalized for different brands.

### Core Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js for the framework foundation
- **Mobile-First Design**: Prioritize mobile experience and responsive design
- **Performance Optimization**: Extremely fast loading and performance (95+ Lighthouse score)
- **SEO Excellence**: Strong technical SEO foundation with full Google crawlability and indexability
- **Component Library**: Utilize 21st.dev elements and shadcn/ui for consistent, high-quality components
- **Template Flexibility**: Generic structure that can be customized for various mobile service businesses
- **Hosting Strategy**: Cloudflare stack for hosting, CDN, and security services
- **Security First**: Rock-solid security with XSS prevention, input sanitization, and comprehensive protection

### Business Context
- Target audience: Mobile service businesses (mechanics, groomers, cleaners, etc.)
- Need for professional web presence that converts mobile visitors
- Emphasis on local SEO and mobile user experience
- Template approach allows for scalable deployment across multiple brands
- **Security Critical**: Handle customer contact info, business data, and potentially payment information

### Current Task: Chat Widget Improvements
**User Request**: Improve the chat widget that appears when "Get A Quick Quote" buttons are clicked or the floating chat overlay in bottom right.

**Specific Requirements:**
1. Remove the phone number from the top of the chat widget
2. Change the header to say "Get A Quick Quote" at the top
3. Change the first message to say "Hi, Ben here. Let me know a little about your car. Your message comes straight to my phone and I'll send your quote ASAP"
4. Update location examples from "Albury, Wodonga, Lavington" to Gold Coast & Northern NSW area suburbs like "Tweed Heads, Burleigh, Helensvale"

**Context**: The business is located in Gold Coast & Northern NSW area, not the border region currently referenced in the chat widget.

### 21st.dev Integration Research

### Component Strategy Analysis
**21st.dev + shadcn/ui Approach:**
- Use 21st.dev for specialized mobile service components
- Leverage standard shadcn/ui for foundational UI elements
- Create custom mobile-service specific components as needed
- Ensure all components are mobile-first and performance optimized
- **Security-First Components**: All form components include validation and sanitization

### UI Development Strategy (Progressive Enhancement)

**Phase 1: Foundation with shadcn/ui (Tasks 1-3)**
- Build complete functional **homepage template** using standard shadcn/ui components
- Establish core layout, navigation, hero section, and business components
- Implement all security, SEO, and performance optimizations
- Result: Fully functional mobile services homepage template

**Phase 2: Enhanced Components with 21st.dev (Task 5-6)**
- Research 21st.dev registry for superior mobile service components
- Replace/enhance specific shadcn components where 21st.dev offers better UX
- Focus areas: hero sections, service cards, booking components, testimonials
- Maintain all security and performance requirements

**Phase 3: Custom Mobile Service Components (Task 6-7)**
- Build specialized homepage components not available in either registry
- Examples: service area maps, booking calendars, before/after galleries
- Mobile mechanic specific: diagnostic forms, vehicle info capture
- Mobile grooming specific: pet info forms, service selection wizards

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- ✅ **Rapid MVP**: Functional homepage template quickly with proven shadcn components
