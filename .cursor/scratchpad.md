# Mobile Services Website Template - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation (Revised)

### Project Overview
Building a generic, mobile-first website template for mobile services businesses (mobile mechanic, mobile dog groomer, etc.) that can be easily personalized for different brands.

### Core Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js for the framework foundation
- **Mobile-First Design**: Prioritize mobile experience and responsive design
- **Performance Optimization**: Extremely fast loading and performance (95+ Lighthouse score)
- **SEO Excellence**: Strong technical SEO foundation with full Google crawlability and indexability
- **Component Library**: Utilize 21st.dev elements and shadcn/ui for consistent, high-quality components
- **Template Flexibility**: Generic structure that can be customized for various mobile service businesses
- **Hosting Strategy**: Cloudflare stack for hosting, CDN, and security services
- **Security First**: Rock-solid security with XSS prevention, input sanitization, and comprehensive protection

### Business Context
- Target audience: Mobile service businesses (mechanics, groomers, cleaners, etc.)
- Need for professional web presence that converts mobile visitors
- Emphasis on local SEO and mobile user experience
- Template approach allows for scalable deployment across multiple brands
- **Security Critical**: Handle customer contact info, business data, and potentially payment information

### Current Task: Location Page Template for Burleigh
**User Request**: Build a location page template starting with `/locations/burleigh` that includes:

**Specific Requirements:**
1. **Hero Banner**: "Mobile Mechanic That Comes To You in [SUBURB]" with location-specific messaging
2. **Location-Specific Content**: "We will come to you in [SUBURB] and work on your car where you need us to - home, work or even if you've broken down. We're a fully equipped mobile mechanic in [SUBURB], reliable and ready to help you now."
3. **Reuse Existing Components**: Same "Get Quick Quote" and "Call Now" buttons as homepage
4. **Google Reviews Integration**: Same Google reviews section as homepage
5. **Template Structure**: Start with hero banner, go straight to footer initially, then layer in new components and sections one by one
6. **SEO Optimization**: Location-specific SEO with suburb targeting
7. **Dynamic Location Support**: Template should work for any suburb/location

**Context**: This creates a foundation for location-based landing pages that can target specific suburbs for local SEO and provide personalized messaging for different service areas.

- Allows installation via shadcn CLI or publishing your own components
- Described as "Dribble for design engineers"
- Compatible with existing shadcn/ui workflow
- Can be used alongside traditional shadcn/ui components

### Cloudflare Stack Integration
**Hosting & Infrastructure:**
- Cloudflare Pages for static site hosting with edge computing
- Cloudflare Workers for serverless functions and API routes
- Cloudflare CDN for global performance optimization
- Cloudflare Security services (WAF, DDoS protection, bot management)
- Cloudflare Analytics for performance and security monitoring

## Key Challenges and Analysis (Current & High-Level)

### Technical Challenges

- Mobile-first indexing readiness
- Local SEO schema markup
- Dynamic sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation
- Metadata API implementation for all pages

### Performance Targets

- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1
- Mobile PageSpeed Score: 90+
- **Cloudflare Edge Performance**: Sub-100ms global response times

### Component Strategy Analysis
**21st.dev + shadcn/ui Approach:**
- Use 21st.dev for specialized mobile service components
- Leverage standard shadcn/ui for foundational UI elements
- Create custom mobile-service specific components as needed
- Ensure all components are mobile-first and performance optimized
- **Security-First Components**: All form components include validation and sanitization

### UI Development Strategy (Progressive Enhancement)

**Phase 1: Foundation with shadcn/ui (Tasks 1-3)**
- Build complete functional **homepage template** using standard shadcn/ui components
- Establish core layout, navigation, hero section, and business components
- Implement all security, SEO, and performance optimizations
- Result: Fully functional mobile services homepage template

**Phase 2: Enhanced Components with 21st.dev (Task 5-6)**
- Research 21st.dev registry for superior mobile service components
- Replace/enhance specific shadcn components where 21st.dev offers better UX
- Focus areas: hero sections, service cards, booking components, testimonials
- Maintain all security and performance requirements

**Phase 3: Custom Mobile Service Components (Task 6-7)**
- Build specialized homepage components not available in either registry
- Examples: service area maps, booking calendars, before/after galleries
- Mobile mechanic specific: diagnostic forms, vehicle info capture
- Mobile grooming specific: pet info forms, service selection wizards

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- ✅ **Rapid MVP**: Functional homepage template quickly with proven shadcn components
- ✅ **Risk Mitigation**: Fallback to standard components if 21st.dev issues arise
- ✅ **Iterative Enhancement**: Upgrade components progressively
- ✅ **Performance**: Only add 21st.dev components that provide real value
- ✅ **Security**: Maintain security validation throughout all phases
