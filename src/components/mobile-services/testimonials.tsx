He found a few issues and was happy to explain them patiently to me and the seller. He also gave me advice on how I should proceed when it comes to servicing and fixing the issues, which allowed me to negotiate the price fairly and drive away with an otherwise fantastic used car. I am impressed and thankful for the great service."
